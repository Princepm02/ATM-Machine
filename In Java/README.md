# ATM Machine Java Code Readme

This repository contains a simple ATM machine simulation implemented in Java. The program provides basic functionalities like checking balance, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, displaying a mini statement, and exiting the ATM session. The code is well-documented to help users understand its functionality and usage.

## Features

1. **Check Balance:** Allows users to check the available balance in their account.

2. **Deposit:** Enables users to deposit funds into their account. The deposited amount must be a multiple of 100 and at least 100.

3. **Withdraw:** Allows users to withdraw funds from their account. The withdrawal amount must be a multiple of 100, at least 100, and not exceed 10000. Additionally, there is a daily withdrawal limit of 20000.

4. **Mini Statement:** Displays a mini statement of recent transactions, including both deposits and withdrawals.

5. **Exit:** Exits the ATM session gracefully.

## Usage

1. **Compilation:** Compile the code using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac`). In your terminal, run the following command:

    ```
    javac atm.java
    ```

2. **Execution:** After successful compilation, run the compiled class:

    ```
    java atm
    ```

3. **Interaction:** The program will display a menu of options. Choose a number corresponding to the desired action:

    - `1`: Check Balance
    - `2`: Deposit
    - `3`: Withdraw
    - `4`: Mini Statement
    - `5`: Exit

4. **Follow Prompts:** Depending on the chosen action, the program will guide you through the necessary steps. Follow the prompts to input appropriate values.

5. **Continuation:** After performing an action, the program will ask if you want to continue. Choose `1` to perform another action or `2` to exit the ATM session.

## Exception Handling

The code uses `try` and `catch` blocks to handle potential input errors. If an invalid input is detected (e.g., non-numeric input), the program will display an error message and redirect the user to the main menu. This helps prevent crashes due to unexpected user input.

```java
try {
    // ...
    cho = sc.nextInt();
    // ...
} catch (InputMismatchException e) {
    System.out.println("Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.\nRedirecting to the main menu!");
    sc.next(); // Clear the invalid input from the scanner
}
```

## Notes

- The code is designed to simulate a simple ATM machine and should not be used for real-world banking operations.

- The code includes comments to explain the purpose and functionality of various sections.

- The ATM simulation enforces certain constraints for deposits and withdrawals to ensure realistic behavior.

- The mini statement displays transaction details and the remaining balance.

- The ATM session can be exited at any time by selecting the "Exit" option.
